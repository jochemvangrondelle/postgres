# PostgreSQL Docker Image (Fork)

## ⚠️ This is a Fork

**This repository is a fork of the [official Docker PostgreSQL image](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres).**

This fork extends the official PostgreSQL Docker images with additional extensions that are commonly needed but not included in the base image.

### Extensions Added

This fork includes the following PostgreSQL extensions:

- **hstore** (via contrib) - Key-value store data type
- **PostGIS** - Spatial and geographic objects support
- **pg_stat_statements** (via contrib) - Execution statistics of SQL statements
- **pgcrypto** (via contrib) - Cryptographic functions
- **timescaledb** - Time-series database extension
- **system_stats** - System-level statistics and monitoring

### OS limited

Only supports:

- Alpine 3.22
- Debian Trixie

### Docker containers

We do not publish Docker images. If you wish to use this work, you have to build the images locally:

```bash
# PostgreSQL 18 Alpine
docker build -t postgres:18-alpine3.22 18/alpine3.22/

# PostgreSQL 18 Debian (trixie)
docker build -t postgres:18-trixie 18/trixie/

# PostgreSQL 17 Alpine
docker build -t postgres:17-alpine3.22 17/alpine3.22/

# PostgreSQL 16 Alpine
docker build -t postgres:16-alpine3.22 16/alpine3.22/
```

### License Information

**Important:** The licensing of this fork depends on the licenses of the included extensions:

- **PostGIS**: GPL v2 or later
